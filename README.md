t.test are for one continous variable, not two
Use bar graph instead for Commodity
Geom_Bar
scatter plots are for two continuous variables
The histogram for CO2 looks good
Sorry guys, but scratch lines 121 - 127 in R
They are not needed, however the ANOVA and production is great
Lines 129-160 is all great
Created a new heat map in Jupyter Notebook
ANOVA for animal species we can do with gas types
As for the heat map, any of the variables that are highly correlated (either positively or negatively) - we can make a scatter plot
If we can get all of this accomplished, we can try a regression model on the most dangerous gases
